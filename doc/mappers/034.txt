=  Mapper 034          =
========================

aka
--------------------------
BxROM
NINA-001


Example Games:
--------------------------
Darkseed               (BxROM)
Mashou                 (BxROM)
Impossible Mission 2   (NINA-001)


Notes:
--------------------------
How these two seperate and completely imcompatible mappers got assigned the same mapper number is a mystery.
BxROM and NINA-001 are both assigned mapper 034, however they both work totally differently.  There is no
reliable way to tell the difference between the two apart from a CRC or Hash check.


=================================
BxROM
=================================

BxROM has bus conflicts... however this mapper also covers some BxROM compatible boards that do
not suffer from bus conflicts.


Registers (**BUS CONFLICTS** sometimes):
--------------------------
  $8000-FFFF:  Select 32k PRG @ $8000

Note on a real BxROM, only the low 2 bits are used (PRG capped at 128k).  But since this is BxROM and
compatible, emus should use all 8 bits



PRG Setup:
--------------------------

       $8000   $A000   $C000   $E000  
     +-------------------------------+
     |             $8000             |
     +-------------------------------+



=================================
NINA-001
=================================

Registers:
--------------------------
  $7FFD:   Select 32k PRG @ $8000
  $7FFE:   Select 4k CHR @ $0000
  $7FFF:   Select 4k CHR @ $1000

I'm not sure whether or not WRAM can also exist at $6000-7FFF


PRG Setup:
--------------------------

      $8000   $A000   $C000   $E000  
    +-------------------------------+
    |             $7FFD             |
    +-------------------------------+

CHR Setup:
--------------------------

      $0000   $0400   $0800   $0C00   $1000   $1400   $1800   $1C00 
    +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
    |             $7FFE             |             $7FFF             |
    +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
