========================


Example Games:
--------------------------
Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (Black)
Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (Red)


Notes:
---------------------------
Regs are at $6000-7FFF, so these games have no SRAM.


Registers:
--------------------------

  $6000-6FFF:  [.CPP ..CC]
    P = Selects 32k PRG @ $8000
    C = Selects 8k CHR @ $0000

  $7000-7FFF:  [..SS IIII]  Sound control  **not sure about this**
    S = Sound Start/Stop:
                 %10 = start sound effect?
       anything else = stop sound effect?

    I = Sound effect ID


Sound:
--------------------------

This mapper has some sort of sample playback mechanism.  Writing to $7xxx starts/stops the currently playing
sample.  How this playback works (apart from the sketchy notes above) is a complete mystery to me.

The sound effects themselves are NOT PART of the .nes file.  Therefore the only real way to support them
currently would be to load external .wav files or something and play them back when they're triggered.
