========================


Example Game:
--------------------------
Maxi 15 (PAL)


Notes:
--------------------------
Verrrry strange.  Registers seem to lie at $FF80-$FFFF... the kicker is that *reading* those addresses also
trigger a register write (the value written is the value being read).

Example:

  LDA $FF80  ; where $FF80 contains $62

would have the same effect on the mapper as:

  LDA #$62
  STA $FF80



Registers:
---------------------------

Range,Mask:   $FF80-FFFF, $FFF8


  $FF80, $FF88, $FF90, $FF98:  [MO.. BBBb]  Reg 0
    M = Mirroring (0=Vert, 1=Horz)
    O = Mode
    B,b = Block selection

  $FFC0, $FFC8, $FFD0, $FFD8:  [???? ????]  Reg 1


  $FFE8, $FFF0:   [.cCC ...P]               Reg 2
   C,c = CHR page
   P = PRG page


Once Reg 0 contains a non-zero value, it is locked and cannot be changed until the system is reset.

?Same is true for Reg 1?

Reg 2 is never locked.



CHR Setup:
---------------------------

8k page @ $0000 selected by the following:

    'O'     CHR page
  ---------------------
     0      %BB BbCC
     1      %BB BcCC


PRG Setup:
---------------------------

32k page @ $8000 selected by the following:

    'O'     PRG page
  ---------------------
     0      %BBBb
     1      %BBBP



On Powerup/Reset:
---------------------------

Regs all filled with 0 and unlocked.
