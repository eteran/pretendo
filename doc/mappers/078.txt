=  Mapper 078          =
========================


Example Games:
--------------------------
Holy Diver
Uchuusen - Cosmo Carrier


Notes:
---------------------------
This mapper number covers two seperate mappers which are *almost* identical... however the mirroring control
on each is different (making them incompatible).  You'll probably have to do a CRC or Hash check to figure
out which mirroring setup to use.

I think some emus might also look at the mirroring bit in the iNES header to determine which setup to use --
however the ROMs I have do not seem to have the mirroring bit set differently, so I don't know how well that
would work (not to mention it's probably not a good idea anyway).

I'm unsure whether or not this mapper suffers from bus conflicts.  Use caution!


Registers:
---------------------------

  $8000-FFFF:  [CCCC MPPP]
    C = CHR Reg (8k @ $0000)
    P = PRG Reg (16k @ $8000)
    M = Mirroring:

       --For Uchuusen - Cosmo Carrier--
        0 = 1ScA
        1 = 1ScB

       --For Holy Diver--
        0 = Horz
        1 = Vert


PRG Setup:
---------------------------

      $8000   $A000   $C000   $E000  
    +---------------+---------------+
    |     $8000     |     { -1}     |
    +---------------+---------------+
