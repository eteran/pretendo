Example Game:
--------------------------
Yuu Yuu Hakusho Final - Makai Saikyou Retsuden


Notes:
---------------------------
MMC3 variant.  For info on MMC3, see mapper 004.

Regs at $6000-7FFF means no PRG-RAM


Registers:
---------------------------

Range,Mask:   $6000-7FFF, $6001

  $6000:  [O... PPPP]
    O = PRG Mode
    P = 16k PRG Page

  $6001:  [.... ...C]
    C = CHR Block select

  $8000-FFFF:  Same as MMC3


CHR Setup:
---------------------------

 'C' selects a 256k CHR block for all the CHR selected by the MMC3.  You can think of this as a CHR-OR of
$000 or $100 depending on 'C'.


PRG Setup:
---------------------------

       $8000   $A000   $C000   $E000  
      +-------------------------------+
O=0:  |              MMC3             |
      +-------------------------------+
O=1:  |     $6000     |     MMC3      |
      +---------------+---------------+

Normal MMC3 PRG setup applies.  If the O mode bit is set, then $8000-BFFF no longer reflects the typical MMC3
setup, and instead has a 16k page selected by $6000.
