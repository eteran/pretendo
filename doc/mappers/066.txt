GxROM and compatible


Example Games:
--------------------------
Doraemon
Dragon Power
Gumshoe
Thunder & Lightning
Super Mario Bros. + Duck Hunt


Notes:
---------------------------
I do not know whether or not this mapper suffers from bus conflicts.  Use caution!

This mapper is INFAMOUS for having bad headers.  Probably 80% or more of these ROMs floating around out
there have the wrong mirroring mode set in the header.

Some games are marked as mapper 066 that are really mapper 140.  See mapper 140 for info.


Registers:
--------------------------
  $8000-FFFF:  [..PP ..CC]
    P = Selects 32k PRG @ $8000
    C = Selects 8k CHR @ $0000
