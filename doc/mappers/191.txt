=  Mapper 191          =
========================


aka:
--------------------------
Pirate MMC3 variant


Example Game:
--------------------------
Sugoro Quest - Dice no Senshitachi (As)


Notes:
--------------------------
This mapper is a modified MMC3 (or is based on MMC3?).

In addition to any CHR-ROM present, there is also an additional 2k of CHR-RAM which is selectable.  Bit 7 of
each CHR reg selects RAM or ROM (1=RAM, 0=ROM)

Apart from that, this mapper behaves exactly like your typical MMC3.  See mapper 004 for details.
