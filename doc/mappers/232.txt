Notes:
--------------------------
This is another Camerica/Codemasters mapper like 071.  Like 071, this mapper also involves a custom lockout
defeat circuit which is mostly unimportant for emulation purposes.  Details will not be mentioned here, but
are outlined in Kevtris' Camerica Mappers documentation.
