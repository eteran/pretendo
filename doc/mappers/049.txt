Example Game:
--------------------------
Super HIK 4-in-1


Notes:
---------------------------

Yet another MMC3 multicart.  For info on MMC3, see mapper 004.

There is no PRG-RAM.  The multicart reg lies at $6000-7FFF, but is only writable when MMC3 PRG-RAM is enabled
and writable (see $A001)


Registers:
---------------------------

  $6000-7FFF:  [BBPP ...O]  Multicart reg
       B = Block
       P = 32k PRG Reg
       O = PRG Mode (0=32k mode)

  $8000-FFFF:  Same as MMC3 for selected block


Each block is 128k PRG and 128k CHR



PRG Setup:
---------------------------

  When the 'O' mode bit is clear, ordinary MMC3 PRG regs are ignored, and instead, 32k PRG page 'P' is swapped
in at $8000.  When 'O' is set, 'P' is ignored, and MMC3 PRG regs work normally for the current block.


Powerup:
---------------------------

$6000 set to 0 on powerup.
