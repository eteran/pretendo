Example Games:

Pocahontas
Super Donkey Kong


Registers:
---------------------------

This mapper is an MMC3 with its registers all scrambled to hell.  Rather than a typical register outline,
this section will "translate" mapper 182 registers to their coresponding "normal" MMC3 counterpart.  For MMC3
details, see mapper 004.

Range, Mask:   $8000-FFFF, $E001


   Mapper 182    MMC3
  --------------------
     $8000        -
     $8001      $A000
     $A000      $8000 (addresses further scrambled, see below)
     $A001        -
     $C000      $8001
     $C001      $C000+$C001 *
     $E000      $E000
     $E001      $E001


A write to $C001 would be like a write to both $C000 and $C001 on a normal MMC3 (sets reload value, and
clears the IRQ counter).

The Address/Data port registers are further scrambled:


   Mapper 182    MMC3
  --------------------
       R:0       R:0
       R:1       R:3
       R:2       R:1
       R:3       R:5
       R:4       R:6
       R:5       R:7
       R:6       R:2
       R:7       R:4

Other than this scrambling mess, the mapper operates exactly like a normal MMC3.
