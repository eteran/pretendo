=  Mapper 074          =
========================


aka:
--------------------------
Pirate MMC3 variant


Example Games:
--------------------------
Di 4 Ci - Ji Qi Ren Dai Zhan
Ji Jia Zhan Shi


Notes:
--------------------------
This mapper is a modified MMC3 (or is based on MMC3?).

In addition to any CHR-ROM present, there is also an additional 2k of CHR-RAM which is selectable.  CHR pages
$08 and $09 select CHR-RAM, other pages select CHR-ROM

Apart from that, this mapper behaves exactly like your typical MMC3.  See mapper 004 for details.
