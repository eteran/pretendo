Example Games:
--------------------------
Image Fight
Major League
Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2


Notes:
--------------------------
Major League seems to want hardwired 1-screen mirroring.  As far as I know, there is no seperate mapper
number assigned to address this issue, so you'll have to rely on a CRC or hash check or something for
treating Major League as a special case.


Registers:
--------------------------

Range,Mask:   $8000-BFFF, $F007



  $8000-$8007:  [PPPP PPPP]    PRG Reg 0
  $9000-$9007:  [.... ..PM]
      P = PRG Mode
      M = Mirroring (0=Vert, 1=Horz) **Ignore for Major League**
  $A000-$A007:  [PPPP PPPP]    PRG Reg 1
  $B000-$B007:  [CCCC CCCC]    CHR Regs
