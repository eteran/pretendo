Example Game:
--------------------------
Magic Dragon


Registers:
---------------------------
I do not know whether or not this mapper suffers from bus conflicts.  Use caution!

  $8000-FFFF:  [PPPP PPP.]
               [CCCC CCCC]
    P = Selects 32k PRG @ $8000
    C = Selects 8k CHR @ $0000

This is very strange.  Bits 1-7 seem to be used by both CHR and PRG.
