aka
--------------------------
CNROM (and compatible)


Example Games:
--------------------------
Solomon's Key
Arkanoid
Arkista's Ring
Bump 'n' Jump
Cybernoid


Registers (**BUS CONFLICTS** sometimes):
--------------------------
  $8000-FFFF:  [CCCC CCCC]
    CHR Reg (selects 8k @ $0000)


Notes:
---------------------------
CNROM has bus conflicts, however mapper 003 is meant to be CNROM and compatible.  So some mappers which were
similar in function, but did not have bus conflicts are included.

Additionally, CNROM's reg is only 2 bits wide... therefore it is capped at 32k CHR.

So to be "safe":
 - for homebrewing:  assume bus conflicts, do not exceed 32k CHR
 - for emudev:  assume no bus conflicts, use all 8 reg bits

There is no PRG swapping.


The game Cybernoid seems to behave very strangely.  It uses unprepped system RAM... and it is as if it
actually relies on bus conflicts (AND written value with value read from address)!
