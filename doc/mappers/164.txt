Example Game:
--------------------------
Final Fantasy V



Registers:
---------------------------

Range,Mask:   $5000-FFFF, $F300

   $5000, $D000:  PRG reg (32k @ $8000)

$6000-7FFF may have SRAM (not sure)


On Reset
---------------------------
Reg seems to contain $FF on powerup/reset


Notes:
---------------------------

Swapping is really simple -- the thing that is funky is the register range/mask.  $5000 and $D000 will access
the register, however $5100, $5200, etc will not.
