=  Mapper 007          =
========================

aka
--------------------------
AxROM


Example Games:
--------------------------
Battletoads
Time Lord
Marble Madness


Notes:
---------------------------
AMROM and AOROM have bus conflicts, ANROM does not
AMROM and ANROM are capped at 128k PRG
AOROM is capped at 256k PRG

There is no CHR swapping.  Every mapper 007 game I've ever seen has CHR-RAM.


Registers (**BUS CONFLICTS** sometimes):
--------------------------
  $8000-FFFF:  [...M .PPP]
    M = Mirroring:
        0 = 1ScA
        1 = 1ScB

    P = PRG Reg  (only 2 bits wide on AMROM/ANROM)


PRG Setup:
--------------------------

      $8000   $A000   $C000   $E000  
    +-------------------------------+
    |             $8000             |
    +-------------------------------+
