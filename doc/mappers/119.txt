Notes:
---------------------------
In addition to any CHR-ROM present, this mapper has 8k CHR-RAM.  CHR-RAM is selectable just like ROM.  Bit 6
of each CHR Reg (R:0 - R:5) indicates whether ROM or RAM is selected (1=use RAM).

Other than that, this mapper is your plain, vanilla MMC3.  See mapper 004 for details.
