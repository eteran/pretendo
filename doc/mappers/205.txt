Example Games:
--------------------------
15-in-1
3-in-1


Registers:
---------------------------
Regs at $6000-7FFF means no SRAM

  $6000-7FFF:   [.... ..MM]  Game Mode / Block

  $8000-FFFF:   MMC3


Notes:
---------------------------
These multicarts select the game mode by writing to $6000-7FFF, the individual games then use traditional
MMC3 style regs at $8000-FFFF.  The MMC3 regs only swap to pages *within* the block specifed by the game
mode.  This can be easily emulated by ANDing the page numbers written to MMC3 with certain values, and then
ORing them with other values, based on the selected block.

Chart below to illustrate:

  Block    PRG-AND     PRG-OR    CHR-AND    CHR-OR
  -------------------------------------------------
   0         $1F        $00        $FF       $000
   1         $1F        $10        $FF       $080
   2         $0F        $20        $7F       $100
   3         $0F        $30        $7F       $180
