"nn nn nn nn"

The four numbers are both hexidecimal.
The first number indicates what the value of $b003 was when the test failed.
The second number indicates what PPU 1K address increment was being scanned
when the test failed.  For instance, 05 corresponds to PPU $1400:$17ff.
The third number indicates the bank that was expected to be seen at that address.
Chr ROM 1K banks are labeled 00:0f; NTA is labelled 80, and NTB is labelled 81.
The fourth number is the bank that was actually seen at that address.
