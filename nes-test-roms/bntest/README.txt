BxROM/AxROM Function Tester
By Damian Yerrick

== Background ==

Because the NES could see only about 32 KiB of ROM at once, NES Game
Pak circuit boards contained hardware called a "mapper" that would
control the upper address lines and let the CPU "turn the page" in
the game program.  But PCBs during the NES era were limited in how
much ROM they supported because they only controlled a small number
of address lines.  For example, BNROM supported four 32 KiB pages for
a total of 128 KiB, while the AxROM family (AMROM, ANROM, and AOROM)
supported up to eight pages or 256 KiB.

NES emulators support an executable format called iNES whose header
specifies which mapper the game uses.  For example, AxROM is 7 and
BxROM is 34.  Many iNES mappers extend the classic discrete mappers
with additional upper address bits.  For example, most emulators
support at least 512 KiB of ROM for mappers 7 and 34.

The PowerPak is a CompactFlash adapter cartridge for the NES.  It
uses authentic NES hardware to play the game but emulates the mapper.
As of PowerPak mappers 1.34, mapper 7 supports only 256 KiB, and
mapper 34 supports only 128 KiB.

== Test instructions ==

Three test ROMs are included:

* bntest_h.nes: mapper 34, vertical mirroring
* bntest_h.nes: mapper 34, horizontal mirroring
* bntest_aorom.nes: mapper 7, one screen mirroring

Source code for ca65 is also included.

"Accessible PRG banks" contains sixteen digits.  Each represents the
result of an attempt to switch to that bank and read one byte.

* 0123456789ABCDEF means all 512 KiB of the ROM is available
* 0123456701234567 means only the first 256 KiB is available
* 0123012301230123 means only the first 128 KiB is available

"Accessible nametables" contains eight digits.  The first four show
$2000, $2400, $2800, $2C00 when D4 of the bank register is set to 0.
The other four show $2000, $2400, $2800, $2C00 when D4 of the bank
register is set to 1.  Identical numbers mean that multiple
nametables are mirrored:

* 01010101 means the nametables are arranged horizontally, that is,
  vertical mirroring
* 00220022 means the nametables are arranged vertically, that is,
  horizontal mirroring
* 00004444 means the nametables are arranged in two separate banks,
  that is, one-screen mirroring

== Results ==

Nestopia and FCEUX:
Both mappers allow access to the entire 512 KiB, as could be
supported by a clone board.

Nintendulator:
Mapper 34 allows 512 KiB, but mapper 7 allows 256 KiB.  This is
consistent with allowing 4 bits (one 74HC161) worth of state.

PowerPak mappers 1.34:
Mapper 7 allows 256 KiB, and mapper 34 allows only 128 KiB, to the
maximum supported by those cartridge boards manufactured by Nintendo.
